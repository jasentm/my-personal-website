As an artist, Jasen believes in active and wholehearted collaboration with an emphasis on fun in conjunction with professionalism.  He ardently believes that if an entire artistic project or process goes by and you haven't had at least a bit of fun, that is a true failure. </p>

In so doing, he has helped facilitate 4 National Conferences, 3 new musical staged readings, including <em>Superhero</em>, with book by John Logan and music and lyrics by Tom Kitt, and 7 new play staged readings including, <em>queens</em> by Martyna Majok, at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in the past 7 years, he has worked to open 8 Off-Broadway shows and 9 Broadway shows, including most recently, <em>How to Dance in Ohio</em>, the first Broadway musical of its kind to cast 7 autistic actors to portray the lives of 7 autisitc young adults. </p>
